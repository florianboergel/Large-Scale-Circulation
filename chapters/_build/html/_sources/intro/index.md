# Welcome to the Large-Scale Circulation and North European Climate Variability Research Group

## About Us
Our group is dedicated to advancing our understanding of climate variability and predictability in Northern Europe, focusing on the complex dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. As climate change accelerates, our goal is to uncover the mechanisms behind multi-decadal climate variability, with particular attention to the Baltic Sea region—one of the most socioeconomically impacted areas in Europe. Through cutting-edge climate modeling, we seek to contribute insights that will improve predictability, guide climate adaptation strategies, and bolster resilience in the face of extreme weather events.

## Research Focus
Our work explores the influence of large-scale circulation patterns, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), on North European climate. Using advanced climate models and pacemaker experiments, we examine how warm and cold climate states drive variability and extreme weather patterns, from heatwaves to storm surges. Our approach is unique in its emphasis on decadal to multi-decadal predictions, aiming to fill critical knowledge gaps in climate science that directly impact ecosystems, communities, and economies across Northern Europe.

## Key Projects and Goals
- **Climate Predictability**: Investigating decadal and multi-decadal climate patterns that impact Northern Europe, offering predictions that enhance resilience planning.
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Identifying statistical patterns in weather extremes (e.g., storms, heatwaves) and examining their future probability, duration, and impact.
- **Socioeconomic Implications**: Addressing the real-world impacts of climate extremes on infrastructure, species migration, and human health, particularly in vulnerable populations.

## Collaborations and Partnerships
Our group collaborates with leading experts and institutions, including the University of Hamburg, the University of Reading, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, to tackle complex climate questions with global and regional perspectives. These partnerships provide a robust foundation for PhD students and early-career researchers to work on high-impact projects in climate science.
